## Notes

- ## Types of Tables in Oracle

1. A **heap-organized** table does not store rows in any particular order. The CREATE TABLE statement creates a heap-organized table by default.

2. An **index-organized** table orders rows according to the primary key values. For some applications, index-organized tables enhance performance and use disk space more efficiently.

3. An **external table** is a read-only table whose metadata is stored in the database but whose data is stored outside the database.

- ## Columns
A table definition is a table name and set of columns.

1. A column identifies an attribute of the entity described by the table. For example, the column ***employee_id*** in the ***employees table*** refers to the * *employee ID attribute of an employee entity.* *
2. In general, you give each column a **column name**, a **data type**, and a **width** when you create a table.

```
Example : CREATE TABLE employees( 
    employee_id    NUMBER(6), 
    first_name     VARCHAR2(20), 
    last_name      VARCHAR2(25)
    )
```
- ## Data Types
1. ### Character Data Type
Character data types store alphanumeric data in strings. The most common character data type is **VARCHAR2**
The **NCHAR** and **NVARCHAR2** data types store Unicode character data.

2. ### Numeric Data Type
The Oracle Database numeric data types store fixed and floating-point numbers, zero, and infinity. Some numeric types also store values that are the undefined result of an operation, which is known as "not a number" or NaN.

- NUMBER Data Type
The **NUMBER** data type stores fixed and floating-point numbers.
The **NUMBER** data type is recommended for most cases in which you must store numeric data.

You specify a fixed-point number in the form **NUMBER** *(p,s)* where *p* and *s* refer to the following 
**Precision** & **Scale**

3. ### Datetime Data Type
The datetime data types are **DATE** and **TIMESTAMP**

- **DATE**
The **DATE** data type stores date and time.

> Note : Dates fully support arithmetic operations, so you add to and subtract from dates just as you can with numbers.

> Oracle Database stores time in 24-hour format â€” HH:MI:SS

- **TIMESTAMP**
The **TIMESTAMP** data type is an extension of the DATE data type.
**TIMESTAMP** stores fractional seconds in addition to the information stored in the DATE data type. The **TIMESTAMP** data type is useful for storing precise time values, such as in applications that must track event order.

> The main advantage of data types **TIMESTAMP** it can store time-zone information in it.the value is adjusted to the time zone of the user session

- ## SELECT STATEMENT

**SELECT** statement or subquery to retrieve data from one or more tables
```
select * from table -- display everything from the specified table
```
```
select col1, col2 from table -- display the info stored in col1 & col2 columns only, from specified table
```
- ## WHERE STATEMENT

The **WHERE** condition lets you restrict the rows selected to those that satisfy one or more conditions.
> If you keep this clause empty, then the database returns all rows from the tables, in the FROM clause.

- ### List of some where conditions to use for filtering records
1. ***=*** - equal to
```
where a.col1 = 10
-- this clause would only show records which have '10' values inside it.
```
2. ***<>*** - not equal to
```
where a.col1 <> 10 
-- this clause would show every records but except the one's with '10' in it.
```
3. **and** - to combine many where function and give records after matching all conditions
```
where a.col1 = 10 and a.col2 = 20 
-- this clause would only show records which satisfy both the conditions.
```
4. **or** - to combine many where function but to give records if any one of the conditions is met
```
where a.col1 = 10 or a.col2 = 20 
-- this clause would show records which satisfy both the conditions or any one of them.
```
5. **in** (to use when filtering a certain list of values instead of repeatedly using or condition)
```
where a.col1 in (10,20,30,40)
-- this clause would show records which have 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 values in it.
```
6. **not in**
```
where a.col1 not in (10,20,30,40)
-- this clause would show records which does not contain 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 values in it.
```
7. **between** (in order to get records in specific range)
```
where a.col1 between 10 and 40
-- this clause would show records which have 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 values in it.
```
8. **like** ( _ [match any one character]  %[matches any number of character] wildcards to use to maximize like function)
```
where a.col1 like '_atch'
-- this clause would show records which matches with any one character followed by 'atch',
it can be Match or it can be Catch 
or it can be any numeric value to like 1atch, 2actch as long as there is a character present before the word 'atch' it would be displayed.
```
```
where a.col1 like '%atch'
-- this clause would show records which matches with any number of character(string or numeric) followed by 'atch'
```
9. **null** - for records with no value
```
where a.col1 is null
-- this clause would show records which have no values in it.
```
10. **not null** - to obtain records having any values of any datatype
```
where a.col1 is not null
-- this clause would show records which have some values in it.
```

- ## Joins
    - **Types of Joins**
    1. **Inner Join**
    - display only the records which have a match in both the table
    ```
    SQL Query

    select * from table1
    inner join table2 on table1.ID = table2.ID
    ```
    2. **Outer Join** -  display records from a table even if the match is not found in another table
    - *Left Join* - A left join includes all the rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
        ```
        SQL Query
        
        select * from table1
        left join table2 on table1.ID = table2.ID
        ```
    - *Right Join* -  A right join includes all the rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
        ```
        SQL Query
        
        select * from table1
        right join table2 on table1.ID = table2.ID
        ```
    3. **Full Outer Join**
    - A full outer join combines all the rows from both Table A and Table B.
    - It includes matching rows based on common values in the specified columns.
    - If there are no matches, NULL values are used to fill in the missing data from the non-matching side.
    ```
    SQL Query

    select * from table1
    full outer join table2 on table1.ID = table2.ID
    ```
